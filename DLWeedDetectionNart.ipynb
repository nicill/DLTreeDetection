    "- Due to the size of the networks, this code will not run in free google colab. Either paid colab or running in locally in a computer with GPU is necessary. In the following I will assume that the code is run in a local computer that has a GPU and is CUDA-capable.\n",
    "- The computer needs to have software to run Python and jupyter notebook. `Anaconda` is recommended. If you are reading this, you most likely have already solved this part.\n",
    "- Apart from this, you need to create a proper virtual environment to run the code into. I recomment creating the environment with `Anaconda` itself and then installing packages using `pip`. At the very least you will need to install:\n",
    "    - opencv (for general image handling)\n",
    "    - pytorch (for general DL computations and the following models fasterRCNN, convnextMaskRCNN, maskRCNN, FCOS, retinanet, SSD  \n",
    "    - ultralytics for YOLO\n",
    "    - Transformers for DETR\n",
    "    - several other smaller libraries for several dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this here it is likely that you already have this, but you should have donwloaded all the code from [this repository](https://github.com/nicill/DLTreeDetection). This notebook along with all `.py` files. Download them using git or just go to the webpage, click `code` and then `download zip`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the folder with the code and this notebook, you should copy the data into it. The data is accessible [her](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b53k3eojxdrf0g0q7q305/NART.zip?rlkey=o8v9fwuqtle8l14w58awjqjmm&st=8lqk3op9&dl=0). Make a `Data` subfolder into the \n",
    "folder that contains the code and decompress the `NART.zip` file into it. You will end up with a Structure like Data->NART->test_image to access the data (there are four folders in the lower level: test_image, test_mask, train_image and train_mask.\n",

    "\n",
    "- \"Train\": Determines whether or not we want to retrain our model. Keep it `True` initially but if you only want to re-test your model, then you can set it to `False`.\n",
    "- \"ep\" contains the number of epochs that the model will be trained for. I recommend running an initial run with one epoch to test if your model works and then set it to whatever value you consider correct. So far a value of 200 is pretty commonly used.\n",
    "- \"batchSize\" is set to 4. This parameter is crucial in terms of speed, the bigger the better. However, if you make it too big then the GPU will run out of memory and the code will crash. I used size 8 in my large computer and every epoch took less than a minute. with size 1 every epoch was about 4 minutes. I recommend testing this extensively before launching into long experiments. The final stages of the code use a bit of extra GPU memory so do not cut it too short.  \n",
    "- \"doYolo\" and \"doPytorch\" control what network(s) we use. I recommend starting with the one-epoch experiment for both YOLO and Pytorch and then setting up individual experiment setting the other value to `False`. For the moment leave the \"doDETR\" parameter at `False`. This is another network that we can compare if we are interested in making a large comparison of models but the code has not been adapted properly and it is not likely to give better results.\n",
    "- the \"numClasses\" parameter is set to `3` and should reflect the number of different weed species present in the label data. If the number is correct you do not need to ever change it.\n",
    "- The \"Train_Perc\" and \"slice\" parameters refer to two previous parameters defined when we created the training data. If you want to change them, go back there, change them there and make sure to re-run the function to create the data (also erase the data previously processed to be sure). Do not change them here.\n",
    "- the    \"Pred_dir\" and \"outTEXT\" parameters contain the route to the output that the algorithm creates. The output for the Yolo algorithm is also stored in \"Train_res\" and \"Valid_res\". Change them if you prefer. **Make sure to check these out as they contain quite a lot of interesting information.** In particular, Yolo will dump lots of tile prediction files into the root of the predictions folder. MaskRCNN will create one subfolder for each parameter configuration. Inside of each subfolder you will find lots of files related to tile and one more subfolder called \"full\". Check this \"full\" folder for the masks of every full image and a \"Pretty\" image that shows the prediction boxes superimposed to the original image along with the category of each one. At this moment Yolo does not create these \"Pretty\" images, it is on the TODO list.\n",
    "- The code produces precision and recall values. **These are detection only.** so they do not concern themselves with whether the weed inside the box is very well segmented or not, only that it is properly found. Also, at this moment they do not check the category of the weed. For example, if a weed is detected correctly (it box is properly placed) but the category is wrong (1 is predicted instead of 2), at this moment this will be counted as a correct prediction. This will be improved in the near future, hopefully.\n",
